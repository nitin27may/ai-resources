# LangGraph 0.2.0 Released - Major Updates to Multi-Agent Orchestration

LangChain has released LangGraph 0.2.0 with significant improvements to multi-agent workflows, new persistence options, and enhanced debugging capabilities.

<!-- more -->

## What's New

### Enhanced Multi-Agent Support

LangGraph 0.2.0 introduces improved patterns for multi-agent orchestration:

- **Parallel Agent Execution**: Run multiple agents concurrently with better coordination
- **Conditional Routing**: More flexible routing logic between agent nodes
- **Shared State Management**: Improved state sharing across agent boundaries

### New Persistence Layer

The update includes a completely rewritten persistence system:

- Support for PostgreSQL, SQLite, and in-memory stores
- Automatic checkpoint creation and recovery
- Better support for long-running workflows

### Debugging Tools

New debugging capabilities make it easier to develop and troubleshoot:

- Visual graph inspection in LangSmith
- Step-by-step execution tracing
- Performance profiling for individual nodes

## Breaking Changes

!!! warning "Migration Required"
    Version 0.2.0 includes breaking changes to the state management API. Review the [migration guide](https://langchain.com/langgraph-migration) before upgrading.

**Key Changes:**
- `StateGraph` constructor now requires explicit state schema
- `add_node` signature updated to support typed states
- Persistence API completely redesigned

## Getting Started

Install the latest version:

```bash
pip install langgraph==0.2.0
```

Update existing code:

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from typing import TypedDict

# Define state schema (new requirement)
class AgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: list
    next_agent: str

# Create graph with typed state
graph = StateGraph(AgentState)
```

## Migration Path

For existing applications:

1. Review your state management code
2. Add explicit state type definitions
3. Update persistence configuration
4. Test thoroughly before production deployment
