# Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and optimizing text inputs to get better outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs). It's a fundamental skill for working effectively with AI systems.

## What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering involves crafting instructions, questions, or contexts that guide AI models to produce desired responses. Good prompts can significantly improve:

- Response accuracy and relevance
- Output quality and consistency
- Task completion success rates
- Model reasoning and explanations
