# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard for connecting AI assistants to data sources and tools. This section covers MCP implementations, best practices, and practical examples.

## What is MCP?

MCP enables secure, standardized connections between AI applications and external resources, allowing AI assistants to:

- Access real-time data from various sources
- Interact with external tools and services
- Maintain context across different systems
- Provide more accurate and up-to-date responses

## Key Components

### MCP Servers
Applications that expose specific capabilities or data sources through the MCP protocol.

### MCP Clients
AI applications or tools that consume MCP server capabilities.

### Protocol Specification
The standardized communication format between clients and servers.

## Use Cases

- **Data Integration**: Connect AI assistants to databases, APIs, and file systems
- **Tool Integration**: Enable AI to use external tools and services
- **Real-time Information**: Provide AI with access to live data feeds
- **Custom Extensions**: Build specialized capabilities for specific domains

## Getting Started

This section will be expanded with practical examples, implementation guides, and best practices for working with MCP.
