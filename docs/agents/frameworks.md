# AI Agent Frameworks

A comprehensive overview of AI agent frameworks categorized by their primary use cases and capabilities. These frameworks will be explored through practical proof-of-concepts (POCs) to understand their strengths and applications.

!!! info "Coming Soon"
    Detailed comparison charts, code samples, implementation guides, and step-by-step tutorials for each framework are currently in development. These resources will include practical examples, performance benchmarks, and best practice recommendations to help you choose the right framework for your specific use case.

## Multi-Agent Orchestration Frameworks

## Workflow & Automation Platforms

### n8n
Open-source workflow automation platform that can integrate AI agents into business processes.
Enables no-code/low-code creation of complex workflows combining AI agents with various services and APIs.

### Langflow
Visual, drag-and-drop interface for building LangChain flows and agent workflows.
Simplifies the creation of complex AI agent pipelines through an intuitive graphical interface.

### Flowise
Open-source UI visual tool to build customized LLM orchestration flows and AI agents.
Provides drag-and-drop interface for creating LLM applications with support for multiple integrations and vector databases.

## Development & Testing Tools

### Diffy
Tool for comparing and testing different AI model outputs and agent behaviors.
Helps in evaluating agent performance and ensuring consistency across different implementations.

## Upcoming POCs

We will be conducting practical proof-of-concepts with these frameworks to:

- **Compare performance** across different use cases
- **Evaluate ease of development** and deployment
- **Test integration capabilities** with existing systems
- **Assess scalability** and production readiness
- **Document best practices** and lessons learned

Each POC will include implementation examples, performance benchmarks, and practical recommendations for real-world applications.
